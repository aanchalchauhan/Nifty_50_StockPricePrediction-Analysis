# Nifty_50_StockPricePrediction-Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of Nifty 50 stock price prediction. 

# Objective :
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the future stock prices of Nifty 50 based on historical data. 
The model will be trained using various technical and fundamental indicators, such as opening price, closing price, and volume. 
The project aims to provide insights and recommendations to potential investors on when to buy, sell, or hold Nifty 50 stocks for optimal returns.

# Insights :
Buying and Selling: The LSTM model can predict the trend of the stock prices, which can help investors make informed decisions about when to buy or sell stocks. If the model predicts an upward trend, investors may consider buying stocks, whereas if it predicts a downward trend, investors may consider selling their stocks.

Volume of Stocks: If the model predicts high trading volume, will result in higher profit it may indicate that the stock is in high demand and may be a good investment opportunity. On the other hand, if the model predicts low trading volume, it may indicate that the stock is not in high demand and may not be a good investment opportunity.

# Usage :
The insights provided by the LSTM model can help investors make more informed decisions about buying and selling stocks, as well as provide insights into market sentiment and trends.
